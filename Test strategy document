***Test Strategy Document for E-commerce Website Testing***

1. Objectives of Testing:

The primary objectives of testing for the e-commerce website are as follows:

    Ensure the functionality of all features meets the specified requirements.
    Validate the usability and user experience for a diverse user base.
    Assess the performance and reliability of the website under various conditions.
    Verify the security measures in place to protect user data.
    Confirm the compatibility of the website across different browsers and devices.
    Evaluate the scalability of the system to handle a growing number of users.

2. Scope of Testing:

The testing will cover the entire e-commerce website, including but not limited to:

    User registration and authentication.
    Product browsing and search functionality.
    Shopping cart management.
    Order placement and payment processing.
    Account management and profile settings.
    Website responsiveness and compatibility.
    Security aspects, including data protection and privacy.

3. Testing Levels:

The testing will be conducted at the following levels:

    Unit Testing: To validate individual components and functions.
    Integration Testing: To verify the interaction and integration of different modules.
    System Testing: To ensure the entire system functions as intended.
    Acceptance Testing: To validate that the system meets business requirements and is ready for deployment.

4. Testing Types:

Various testing types will be employed, including:

    Functional Testing: To ensure that all features work according to specifications.
    Usability Testing: To assess the user-friendliness of the website.
    Performance Testing: To evaluate the website's speed, responsiveness, and scalability.
    Security Testing: To identify and mitigate potential security risks.
    Compatibility Testing: To ensure the website works seamlessly across different browsers and devices.
